# Snugville

Welcome snugs to Snugville.  It's only the snuggiest place on planet or and maybe... beyond.

# Setup

Clone the repo :) and run `brew install go`

## Setting up your $GOPATH

In your (.bashrc, .profile, .zshrc, et al) add the following line `export GOPATH=/path/to/your/repo/snugville`, example `export GOPATH=$HOME/code/snugville`

To immediately load the change run `source ~/.zshrc` or whatever shell file you use.

Additionally, if you want to use any installed go binaries you'll want to add the `bin` folder in your `GOPATH` to your `PATH`

## Visual Studio Code

Install the `Go` extension from `lukehoban`, this will make your experience with go beyond better.  The extension is found here `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lukehoban.Go`.  Enabling `go.useLanguageServer` in Settings will give additional information whilst go-coding.

## Initializing
